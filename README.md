## Hydro Frost

With the the growing use cases of Hydro Tokens. from Hydro-Pay, Hydro Vault, and Hydro-DappStore, 
Project Hydro is rapidly growing and is getting a lot of interest from the crypto community.
And while the Hydro tokens and ERC-1484 act as the center of the ecosystem, 
there is no easy way to explore or search the history of a ERC-1484 or EIN.

Hydro Frost is a Proof of Concept Web-App designed specifically for Hydro Token and Hydro Snowflake.
It will act as a scanner or explorer for Snowflake Accounts or ERC-1484.

Users can Search an EIN Account through Hydro Frost and track or explore
transaction history as well as the current wallet balance of a specific EIN

by doing a simple search, you can view the Deposit history of an Ethereum account to an EIN account,
as well as the Withdrawal of an EIN account to Ethereum account. 
You can also view recieved and sent transactions between EINs
and also the resolver that it currently has.

I believe this is a good use case for a rapidly growing ecosystem.
